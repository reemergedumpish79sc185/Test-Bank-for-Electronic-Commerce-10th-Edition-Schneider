Chapter 1

Step 1 of 2



Following are few reasons why **luxury goods producers might have been hesitant to sell online**:

• Fear that products would lose their exclusivity associated with these brand names.

• Producers might have thought that they don’t have the need to find a low-cost distribution channel or establish an online presence to protect their brand as luxury goods more about the exclusive distribution while the Internet is assumed for mass distribution





Step 2 of 2



Eventually as the world of online shopping is growing, luxury good **producers might have changed their way of thinking about online selling for the following reasons**:

• Luxury goods market is also growing and consumers are becoming more and more aware of attributes like quality, craftsmanship and utility have become just as important as the brand name itself.

• High income people shop more frequently and spend more time online than medium-income persons.

• Wealthy people buy even in recession better than others income groups and continue to purchase goods both online and at physical stores.




Chapter 2

Step 1 of 3



The ICANN provides a grace period of five days to the registrants of domain in the beginning of the registration process. This grace period is provided to check the accidental registrations or any errors in the names registered. However, the registrants started misusing this grace period for other purposes.

**Domain tasting** is the practice of registering a domain name and testing whether it has sufficient traffic to provide income greater than the annual registration fee. If it seems that the name would provide sufficient profit then to keep it, otherwise use the “add grace period” to withdraw the domain without paying any cost.





Step 2 of 3



ICANN has taken certain measures to stop domain tasting. A fee of $0.20 is charged to those who register numerous domains and they have to return the percentage of domains each month. It can easily affect those people who work with large quantities of domains.

Moreover, thousands of domain names get deleted under this measure to prevent domain tasting.





Step 3 of 3



These majors to stop domain tasting started in 2008 when domain tasting had suddenly increased and has become a serious problem. The benefits of the measures are now clearly visible. The number of domain tasting has come down from 15 million domains a month to 2 million per month. Also, there has been an increase in actual purchase of domains since then.
